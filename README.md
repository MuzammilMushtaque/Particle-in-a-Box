# Numerical Solution of Schrödinger Equation for Particle in a Box

## Overview

This repository contains code and documentation for numerically solving the time-independent Schrödinger equation for a particle in a box. The Schrödinger equation describes the behavior of quantum systems, and for a particle in a box, it provides insights into the energy levels and wave functions of the confined particle.


## Introduction

The time-independent Schrödinger equation for a particle in a box is given by:

\[ -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{d^2 \psi(x)}{dx^2} + V(x)\psi(x) = E \psi(x) \]

This code provides a numerical solution to this equation using numerical diagonalization method.
